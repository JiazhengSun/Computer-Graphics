# Object and Animation
Creating a Poliwhirl using basic 3D objects such as cylinders and spheres, plus the application of matrix stack and transformation techniques and texture mapping. In the animation script, an extra object Electrode is created the same way. Then by using matrix transformation, camera manipulating, lighting changes etc, a simple animation is thus created.
